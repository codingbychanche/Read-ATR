A collection of C- Language subroutines and tools for processing *.ATR image files. 

Version
=======
Check individual source file.

License
=======
Not a clue yet. Which one should I use? For a start, please follow these simple rules:

    You are allowed to copy, distribute the files of this collection for non comercial use, as 
    often as you wish.
    
    Always include this file 'readme.md' with your copy.

    You are allowed and encouraged to chage and improve the source code files. 
    I would appreciate if you sent me a note on what you did.
 
Contents
========
The files named '_D2x_....'' are the main part of this collection. They are well documented but, for the time
being, german only. I'am sorry for that but, you are invited to contribute and everybody - no matter
if you can code or not - is invited to translate and create an english version.

The file ST.img is an FAT12 Atari ST compatible disk image that can be used with ST emulators such as
'NOStalgia'. The Image contains the latetes binary for TOS. 

File Structure
==============
File names resemble what the code does. All library routines for the Atari DOS 2.x FMS are called '_D2x_*.*'. 
All source code files and binarys using the Dos 2.x library functions are called 'at*.*' ('atdir' for example). 

Source Code structure
=====================
Function names resemble their origin. For example: D2x_init_image(....); shows, that this function can be found
within one of the files named '_D2x_*.*'
 
How can I use it?
=================
Have a look at the contents of the 'bin' folder. There you can find various tools  and their source
files making use of the library.
